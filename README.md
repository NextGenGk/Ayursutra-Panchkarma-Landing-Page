## About

This project is a landing page designed to promote Ayursutra Panchkarma treatments. It's built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, and TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code maintainability and developer experience.

The landing page aims to provide potential clients with information about Panchkarma, its benefits, and the services offered by Ayursutra. It targets individuals interested in holistic wellness and alternative medicine.

The key technologies used include Next.js for its performance and SEO benefits, TypeScript for type safety, and potentially a UI library like Tailwind CSS or Material UI for styling. The architecture follows a component-based approach, making it easy to add new sections and features. The unique selling point is its focus on presenting traditional Ayurvedic treatments in a modern and engaging way.
